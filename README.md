## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What type of job is the most popular one?
2. What type of developer has the highest level of salary?
3. How would different programming styles affect salary?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are two notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. 
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. 

Raw data and data schema is also uploaded as a supplement.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@chrrhyghy/data-analysis-result-for-stackoverflow-2017-data-8fc659ce2a38).
